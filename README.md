# Final Capstone Project - Wanderlust

## Description
This project was one of the final capstone projects within the HyperionDev Web Development Bootcamp.

It is based around a passion of mine - travel!

I have used **HTML**, **CSS**, **Bootstrap** and **JavaScript** to create a responsive, interactive, and (hopefully) engaging website.  Session storage has been utilised to add and store comments and present 'saved' data to the user based on their actions.  The user can 'like' images across the site and they are able to submit forms for an email subscription and to send a message, albeit, without full backend fucntionality.

## Installation

To install locally, you will need to clone the repository.  You can follow the guidance [here](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/creating-and-managing-repositories/cloning-a-repository).   



## Usage

This is quite a visual website, so it is primarily designed for users to view content and images.
That said, there are a number of ways the user can interact with the pages.  The main functionality that a user can engage with includes:

### Adding comments on the Home Page

Users can add comments on the home page, where data is stored in localStorage and presented back in reverse chronological order, so latest comment first...

### 'Liking' images

Although not linked to a backend, users can 'like' images but clicking the heart symbols (on and off), which are dynamially updated accordinly to show the user that their action has been registerd.

### 'Saving' items for later viewing

Here, users can make use of the 'save' functionality, which allows them to save cards about a particular destination.  These are stored in localStorage and then the content is presented back to the user on a separate 'Saved Items' page.

### Submitting a message via a contact form

A user can enter their email address, name and a message, and the form simulates process of sending that message.  In this instance, an output is presetned in the console, and the form is cleared ready for a new input.
